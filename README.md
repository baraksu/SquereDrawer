# The purpose of this code
this code suppose to generate a square base on the user's want
the code asks the user to put in three inputs 
one is the square's length, two is the square's width, and three is the characters the square is made of.
The user can put any number between 1-9 in the width and length and any character.

# Running examples

# Stages of development
Firstave developed the input stages and the filters (it t be zero and must be a number) after that I made the drawer of the square and fixed the least last, making messages more appealing

# Things I can add to the project
Firstly I can add the zero filters and the characters filters directly in the functions
and I can maybe cut some code lines to make the code more compact

# How it feels making the projact
The project was an emotional rollercoaster, filled with anticipation, challenges, and eventual triumph, leaving me feeling accomplished and personally transformed.
